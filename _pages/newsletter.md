**Impact of Soil Hydraulic Parameter Variability on Soil Moisture: An Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis**   
**Published:** February 6, 2025  

**Summary:**  
This articles uses Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to reveal how variations in soil hydraulic parameters drive major differences in soil moisture simulations. The work highlights the uncertainty introduced by different parameterization schemes and calls for improved soil-property representations in land surface models.

**Can Foot-Flush Reduce Cholera Spreading?**   
**Published:** December 5, 2024  

**Summary:**  
Drawing on my undergraduate thesis, I proposed a foot-operated toilet valve to cut hand contact with surfaces and curb cholera transmission. Inspired by pandemic-era hands-free designs, the mechanism promises affordability and ease of adoption, pending sponsorship for prototyping.

**Africa Needs More Investment in Climate Action**   
**Published:** December 3, 2024  

**Summary:**  
Highlighting a US$52.7 billion annual gap in adaptation funding, Kachinga Silwimba warns that underinvestment leaves African nations exposed to droughts, power crises, and other climate risks. He urges stronger collaboration between researchers and policymakers to secure the resources needed for effective mitigation and resilience.
