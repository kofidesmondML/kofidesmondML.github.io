Hello! I'm **Desmond Kofi Boateng**, a PhD student in Computing at **Boise State University**. My current research focuses on **kernel methods in operator learning** and **neural networks for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)**.

### Academic Background

- **PhD in Computing**, Boise State University (USA)  
  *Research: Kernel methods, neural operators, PDE learning*

- **Master's in Mathematical Sciences**, AIMS Rwanda  
  *Thesis: Comparative Analysis of Singular Value Based Decomposition Methods for Image and Video Compression (in Julia)*

- **Bachelor's in Mathematics**, University of Ghana  
  *Thesis: Khovanov's Categorification of the Jones Polynomial*

### Professional Experience

Previously, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Cape Wesley Consulting**, where I built:
- High-level web scrapers for large-scale data extraction
- NLP models for text classification
- Solutions for computer vision and image processing tasks

### Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, Julia, SQL, Bash  
- **ML/DL**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Transformers, OpenCV  
- **Math/Scientific**: PDEs, Kernel methods, SVD, Linear algebra, Category theory  
- **NLP & CV**: Text classification, vectorization, image/video compression  
- **Data**: pandas, NumPy, Spark, Selenium, BeautifulSoup  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Git, Docker

### Research Interests
